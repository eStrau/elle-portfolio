        projectOverview: 'Society of Women Engineer\'s Team Tech Project, which focused on improving last year\'s satellite schedule by adding new features for filtering and visualizing. The team consisted of 5 subteams: an aerospace, 2 backend, and 2 frontend teams, who all collaborated to build the project.',

        role: 'For this year, I took upon the role of being a subteam lead, where I was in-charge of planning and leading a team. My team focused on frontend development, where we got to work on the new feature of implementing the map for visualization. The objective of my team was to create a visual that shows the satellite\'s current locations on a map and its projected path. Through our map, we allowed users to search up the satellite by ID value and filter by the date. The search functionality also included user validation and would auto populate the various satellites. This team worked closely with the other frontend team to ensure the design was cohesive and consistent throughout. Furthermore, I worked with their lead to ensure the navigation to the map page was simple. As a team lead, I was responsible for setting the goals and tasks of the team, and hosting bi-weekly meetings. Through our meetings, I would delegate responsibilities to my team and check in with their progress to see if they need any assistance as for many of them it was their first time working with frontend code.',
        takeaways: 'This experience allowed me to not just work in the team setting, but also made me responsible for guiding the team and providing updates to our Team Tech leads. I got to immerse myself in collaboration and see how computer science can intertwine with other fields of engineering. I learned a great deal about being a leader and effective communication. With my team, I was constantly sending updates and progress reports as well as check in with team members when they missed a meeting. Unfortunately, my team members start to trickle off towards the end of the project, which left me having to pick up their tasks. However, it did teach me a lot of coding frontend and implementing a search bar, which was incredible to see the validation work and auto populating features. Although coding can be frusturating, it is always amazing to see the end product and getting to work with all the different subteams was incredible and very helpful for the diverse perspectives. I learned about project management and planning effectively to ensure you can meet the timeline, which was the end of April as we start in January coding the project.',
        description: 'Through Society of Women Engineers (SWE), I was able to be a part of their Team Tech, which partners students with an industry leader to help them build a solution to their problems. Our team got to work with CACI who specializes in technology for the US government, and has partnered with SWE in the past. This year\'s project focused on improving our work last year, which focused on developing a website that would display a 7-day satellite schedule. With this in mind, we focused on bring in new features, like improving the UI to account for time zones and ground stations, and adding a map for visualization. Through this project, our team was able to collaborate with CACI engineers to improve our project and produce new features. Team Tech divided into three sub areas: Aerospace, Backend, and Frontend. We had a total of 5 different subteams, who each worked on different parts of the projects. The aerospace team focused on researching how weather can impact a satellite\'s path and how the algorithm could be adapted to reflect the weather conditions as well as understanding the best possible path between ground stations (which ground station should we use). There were two backend teams, which leveraged c++ and MongoDB as our database. One of the backend subteams focused on figuring out whether the previous database of MongoDB could be switched to MySQL to output the json files that are used by the frontend teams. The other backend team focused on updating our algorithm for producing the schedule since we previously used a greedy algorithm but would like to upgrade to the NSGA-II algorithm. For the two frontend teams, one of the teams focused on a new feature, which was visualizing on a map the satellite\'s approximate location and path. While the other team revised our schedule part to make it more user friendly and customizable by adding a download feature, filtering by ground station, and enabling time zone conversions.',
