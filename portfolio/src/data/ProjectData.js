Raise the Bar distinguishes itself from other workout applications by including an interactive user interface that enables users to check off exercises as they are completed, different routines catered to users depending on how often they expect to work out, and a user profile that tracks workout progress. This all comes together to create a satisfying workout experience for gym enthusiasts, who will no longer endlessly search through sources to find desirable exercise routines, and no longer need to use non-digital, inefficient means to try and keep track of their workout progression.",

InDepth interfaces directly with Google Sheets, and takes in the URL of an attendance Google Sheets workbook that an organization uses and parses through the data of a specified individual attendance sheet. That data is then appended to a total attendance sheet, a sheet containing unique members and their attendance counts, and an email list to upload to the organization ListServ. Future extensions to the project include UI enhancements, further documentation, and options that allow the softwareâ€™s functions to be more customizable to the context of the user.",

Breaking Down Bias has three main features (Country Comparator, World View, and World Map) for the user to interact with and our home screen, which explains the importance of the topic and a quick break down of the categories studied. With the Country Comparator feature, users can compare the impact of bias between two different nations, gaining insights into the unique challenges each country faces. Breaking Down Bias sheds light on the disparities affecting communities worldwide. Delve deeper with the World View feature, where we dissect the four dimensions of bias (political, physical, educational, and economic) and illustrate how each gender perceives them. Through interactive charts and analysis, users gain a comprehensive understanding of the nuanced layers of societal prejudice and how even women themselves can hold these biases. Navigate the landscape of bias with ease using the World Map function, allowing users to filter and visualize bias percentages across the globe. The filter feature enable us to observe closely the percentages of bias, whether it no bias, at least one bias in the dimension, or specific dimension bias.",
