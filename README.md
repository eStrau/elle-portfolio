# elle-portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio!

This is the code for my personal portfolio, which has been built using React.js, HTML/CSS, and Material UI, and deployed through GitHub pages. I created my website to showcase my journey through the world of computer science. I made the first iteration of my website by attending a semester long series in my first year at the University of Florida, where I got to build this from scratch with some amazing guidance. For that point, I have been updating my website to reflect my current experiences. Over the summer of 2024, I decide to redo my whole website as my experience with React.js has grown and wanted the website to show this. This is my most up-to-date portfolio. However, you can still view my first iteration's repository and deployed website through these two links: <https://github.com/eStrau/wisceReact> and <https://estrau.github.io/wisceReact/>.
